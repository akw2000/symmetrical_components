# matlab code to calculate symmetrical components or phase components

Input: enter the symmetrical comoponents or phase components as polar format in line 2,4,6 

Uncomment "out = inv(l)*ph"  to find symmetrical components if phase components given

Uncomment "out = l*ph" to find phase components if symmetrical components given
